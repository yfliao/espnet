        "Speaker recognition is a typical task that conduct utterance-level classification.  Specifically, we will map an utterance into a pre-defined category. Recall that the ASR is doing a sequence-to-sequence task, so we can easily utilize ASR by using a 1-length sequence (i.e., class). Following this concept, we can start to implement the speaker recognition system! Noted that following the definition of the lecture, today, we will focus on **speaker identification** (close-set classification) instead of **speaker verification**.\n",

For more details, please refer to its [original paper](http://www.danielpovey.com/files/2015_icassp_librispeech.pdf).
